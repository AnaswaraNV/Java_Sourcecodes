Creating Java Packages

Lab Exercise 1A 

Scenario: Create the package in the working directory.

1. Download three Java source files and put them in 
   your working directory(e.g. c:\temp).
   	- PackageDemo.java, May.java, August.java.

2. a) Inspect May.java and August.java. What is the package name?

   b) Inspect PackageDemo.java. What is the package name?


3. Create a subfolder with the name "seneca."

4. Under the "seneca" subfolder, create another subfolder with the 
   name "summer2004."

5. Move May.java and August.java into the "summer2004" subfolder.

6. How do you compile PackageDemo.java?

   (Hint: Read the comments at the end of the source file.)

7. Inspect the "summer2004" subfolder. 
   Do you find class files there?

8. How do you run PackageDemo.class?


Lab Exercise 1B 

Scenario: Create the package in another directory (e.g. c:\elsewhere).

1. Create a directory such as c:\elsewhere.

2. Creat the package in this directory. (Repeat steps 1 to 4 in Lab Exercise 1A.)

3. Go to your working directory(e.g. c:\temp) where you have PackageDemo.java.

4. How do you compile and run PackageDemo.java?
   (Hint: Read the comments at the end of the source file.)


Lab Exercise 2 

Scenario: PackageDemo.java is packaged with May.java and August.java.

0. Select your root directory for the package "seneca.summer2004" (e.g. c:\elsewhere or c:\temp).

1. Comment out the statement "import seneca.summer2004.*;" 
   in PackageDemo.java.

2. Insert the statement "package seneca.summer2004;" at the
   beginning of PackageDemo.java.

3. Where are you going to put PackageDemo.java?

4. Try the following 2 commands:

	javac   ./seneca/summer2004/PackageDemo.java

    java    seneca.summer2004.PackageDemo
      	
      	
Lab Exercise 3A(if you have time)

Scenario: Create three packages with these classes:
	     lab3.testing.PackageDemo, opensource.seneca.January, 
	     seneca.summer2004.May, seneca.summer2004.August.
	     

1. Modify the lab3.testing.PackageDemo class such that its toString method will invoke the toString methods
   from opensource.seneca.January, seneca.summer2004.May and seneca.summer2004.August. 
   (Note: Do not forget to create the opensource.seneca.January class.)
   
2. Select your working directory such as c:\temp.

3. Put all three packages in the working directory.

4. How do you compile and run lab3.testing.PackageDemo in the working directory?
   (Note: The lab3.testing.PackageDemo class has the main method.)
   

5. Make a contribution to the wiki by sharing your answer with the community. 
   You may upload a screenshot to the wiki.

Lab Exercise 3B(if you have time)

1. Change your working directory (e.g. c:\temp\testjava)
   such that it is not the root directory for the packages.

2. How do you compile and run lab3.testing.PackageDemo in the working directory?

C:\Temp>java -classpath c:\elsewhere lab3.testing.PackageDemo
javac -classpath c:\com\seneca\f2017\data edu.jav745.f2017.client.BankingClient.java
